This is ordered like so:
a b c b a a b c
So we first learn in the intended order (a b c), reverse our way to a
fitting context for the first task, then reiterate again in the intended
order.

Ideally we wouldn't have to reverse the curriculum for re-iteration, but
automatic context localization requires another mechanism (e.g. multiclass
perceptron) which is not yet implemented.
