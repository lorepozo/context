In the field of artifical intelligence, there are many remarkable mechanisms for learning in a specified manner, but these lack the generality that is apparent in human cognition. Such generality is the problem of knowledge, and most learning mechanisms improve their specialization with a flat knowledge base that's focused in a single confined domain. This is flawed as a model of cognition because it reduces capability of both handling very complex problems and specializing in multiple domains. For this superUROP project, I aim to design a contextual knowledge system and augment learning mechanisms to utilize it in a manner that reduces the intractability of hard problems and is inter-operable between distinct learning mechanisms.
